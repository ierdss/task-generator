## Purpose

My goal is to make the Udemy courses into digestible chunks for myself and to add those tasks into my system in Todoist. However, I am just too lazy to create multiple tasks on Todoist one by one.

## Usage

1. download this project
2. run `npm install`
3. run `node index.js`
4. answer the following questions

```js
// Here is an example
{
  "section": "37",
  "start": "322",
  "end": "328"
}
```

### Warning

Adding multiple tasks in Todoist may be slow.
